## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I pulled the trigger on a Pro subscription to open up more challenges and give me access to the Figma files. It makes a **world of difference** having access to the Figma files to see the font sizes for mobile and desktop, be able to work out the exact padding and margins, and see how exactly drop shadows are made. The only downside is that it took me _a lot longer_ to do this project because I wanted everything to be perfect.

I used an abundance of clamps in my CSS to keep the media queries a bit simpler and allow the text and padding to grow with the page so it would look great on mobile, tablet, and desktop. It took a bit of math to figure out the ideal clamp sizes, but I'm happy with how it turned out.

Additionally, this was my first time using Sass and I enjoyed it a lot! I didn't use a lot of Sass-specific features, but liked being able to nest CSS styles and have my stylesheet be a lot more specific. I'm sure this would be a tremendous help on a larger website to avoid CSS conflicts.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs - Clamp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) - This resource helped me set up clamps well on font sizes and padding to make for a perfectly responsive site.
- [Sass Cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/sass) - This was my first time using Sass and I relied on this cheatsheet a bit to help me remember how to use variables, mainly. I'm sure I'll be relying on this more as I need to get into loops and more complex Sass.

## Acknowledgments

[CodeSTACKr's](https://www.youtube.com/codeSTACKr) YouTube video _[Sass Tutorial for Beginners - CSS With Superpowers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs&t=463s)_ was very helpful in getting me up and running with Sass quickly and without having to install anything on my computer.

This is where you can give a hat tip to anyone who helped you out on this project. Perhaps you worked in a team or got some inspiration from someone else's solution. This is the perfect place to give them some credit.
